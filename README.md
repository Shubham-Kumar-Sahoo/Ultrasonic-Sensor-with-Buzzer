# Ultrasonic-Sensor-with-Buzzer
In this project I have created a code for an Ultrasonic Sensor in the Arduino IDE. If an object is present within 10cm of the sensor then buzzer will work.

To run the program :-  
Open Ultrasonic Sensor.ino on Arduino IDE and connect an Ultrsonic Sensor with Arduino to the device's port and execute the program
